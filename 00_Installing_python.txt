The following are install instructions to install the necessary packages to get us start, 
this is manually install everything, I used this way, but you can also use some existing 
Scientific Python distributions, which contains most of the scientific tools you will use
in the future. You can checkout here: http://www.scipy.org/install.html

##############Now we are talking about how to install packages by yourself################

(1) Install Homebrew (it is much better than macports/fink)
check out here: http://brew.sh/

Note: You'll need to add the Homebrew directory to the front of your system path, in order
to ensure that Homebrew-installed software is given priority over any other versions. To 
do so, open the .bash_profile in your user directory (that's the ~ directory or, more 
verbosely, /Users/[your_user_name]) and add the following line (if you don't have a 
.bash_profile, just create one with any text editor): export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

(2) Install python (if you don't have one)
$brew install python

(3) Install gfortran (if you don't have one)
$brew install gfortran

(4) Install pip (if you have Homebrew installed, pip installs with python in step 2)
$easy_install pip 

##############Now let's install the python packages we need ##############################
(5) Install ipython
$pip install ipython

(6) Install numpy 
$pip install numpy

(7) Install scipy (need gfortran installed)
$pip install scipy

(8) Install matplotlib (plotting lib)
$pip install matplotlib

(9) Install pandas (this is a powerful data structures for data analysis)
$pip install pandas

(10) Install obspy
$pip install obspy

Note: the latest verion of obspy is 0.9.0, which updated in Jan 2014, if you installed 
your obspy before that date, update your obspy to the latest version. You can check the 
version of your obspy by typing the following in python:
>>>import obspy
>>>obspy.__version__

(assume you that you installed obspy using pip before, so, just do 'pip install -U obspy' 
to update to the latest version). 

##########################################################################################
You might need update the $PYTHONPATH in your .bash_profile, add more path in the future,
if you installed the package, say you want to check numpy, but when you type 'import numpy'
in python, if you run across an error 'no module named numpy', most of the time, it is 
because this python path issue, just check that. 
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH

check out the following link how to install in details:
http://www.lowindata.com/2013/installing-scientific-python-on-mac-os-x/
##########################################################################################

After you installed all the packages, a couple of ways to check if you installed all these
packages:
(1) just into python, and type 'import numpy' (or other packages)
(2) using pip to show all the installed packages:
$pip list

Let me know if you have any question.
